# ✈️ RAG Agent with LangGraph & ChromaDB  

## Overview  
This project is an **experimental Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** powered by **LangGraph**.  
The agent intelligently decides how to answer user queries by:  

- 🔍 Querying a **ChromaDB** vector store (knowledge base)  
- 🌐 Performing a **web search via Tavily** if local knowledge is insufficient  
- 💬 Leveraging **recent conversation history** when context alone is enough  

Currently, the project is in its **early development stage**.

## 🔮 Future Plans - testing
- 🧠 Long-term memory store  
- 🎨 **Streamlit** for frontend interface  
- ⚡ **FastAPI** for API deployment
